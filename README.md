This is a game created using Pygame, adapted from a tutorial found on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61eX0bFAsYs&amp;t=9914s).

In the game, players control a spaceship that can move up, down, left, and right, and can also shoot projectiles. The scene features falling rocks, jcp objects, and diamonds from the top of the screen. The objective is to use the projectiles to destroy these objects and earn a higher score.
